## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #1
first exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:  1, 3, 6, 10, 15
* Write a function that returns the number of dots when given its corresponding triangle number of the sequence.
